## loop structures in Python

There are two main types of loops in Python: `for` loop and `while` loop.

1. **For Loop:**
   - A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range). The loop iterates through each item in the sequence and executes a block of code for each iteration.

   ```python
   for item in sequence:
       # code to be executed for each item in the sequence
   ```

   Example:

   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
   for fruit in fruits:
       print(fruit)
   ```

2. **While Loop:**
   - A `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`. The loop continues until the condition becomes `False`.

   ```python
   while condition:
       # code to be executed while the condition is True
   ```

   Example:

   ```python
   count = 0
   while count < 5:
       print(count)
       count += 1
   ```

   In this example, the `while` loop prints the value of `count` as long as it is less than 5. The loop terminates when `count` becomes 5.
